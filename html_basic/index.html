    <h1> Welcome to My First Super Cool Webpage</h1>
    <p> This is my very first time creating a webpage using HTML. It's quiet simple, clean and gives a good standing point.</p>

    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <p> I am learning how to build websites from the onset. This is part of my journey into front web development.</p>

    <h3> What I like</h3>
    <p> I enjoy exploring in the IT world, learning the programming languages and turning ideas into interactive web experiences.</p>

    <p>In future, i would like to work on complex projects and build web applications </p>
